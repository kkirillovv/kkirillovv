### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I want to become a Front-end developer! I am committed to serious work, professional growth and career development in the next 2 years. This is important to me because I want to help my friends and launch a project with them across the country and the nearest neighbors. I hope to implement a lot of my ideas in it.
